# Pong-A-Long
Pong in SDL Tutorial Series by Jon Moore

This repository is a C++ tutorial creating a Pong clone game using the SDL library.  The tutorials are part of my personal channel on www.gameinstitute.com, I hope to eventually host these tutorials on the web at a later date.

The solution provided is for Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community on Windows.  It is left to users of other compilers and/or OSes to create their own solution/project files.
